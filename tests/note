What does this check: 
    - Initialize memory (0x1038) to 0xCBAE05FA 
    - Ensure simple LDW and STW work
    - Checks that first LDW brings new line and stalls pipeline
    - Checks that the first STW hits on the D$ but is queued on the store buffer
    - Checks that the second LDW stalls the pipeline and we perform the ST that was on the ST buffer
        - R5 = 0xCBAE0604
    - Checks that we can perform byte accesses to memory (2 STB)
    - Checks that the second STW is placed on way 1 of the set 1 of D$
    - Checks that the third STW is placed on way 0 of set 1 of D$ and this causes an evict of way 0, which
      implies performing the 2 STB on the store buffer

- If evertyhing goes as expected we should see the next values on the registers:
        - R0 = 0x7
        - R1 = 0x3
        - R2 = 0xA

    - An illegal instruction will raise after last STW is executed since the fetch will

What does this check: 
    - The src code will produce a cache bus error exception when trying to LD from incorrect address.
    - This will force the core to jump to the exception handler at address 0x2000
        - Then, this will save the values for R28,R29,R30.
        - Next, it will NOT hit on iTLB nor dTLB xcpt checks, and will jump to 0x2800 where it will:
            - Write R26 with 0x6BCD to note that is a different type of xcpt.
            - Restore the value for R28,R29,R30.
            - Perform an IRET.

    - It will then start executing from PC 0x1018, which was the instruction that caused cache bus error
      exception. But since we returned from xcpt handler, now the privilege mode is User mode, and this 
      means that TLB is now enabled. 

    - The PC 0x1018 is sent to iTLB and it misses, this generates an iTLB exception that is propagated up 
      to the WB stage where it forces the core to jump to the exception handler again at address 0x2000.
      The privilege mode is then changed to Supervisor.
        - Then, this will save the values for R28,R29,R30.
        - Next, it will HIT on iTLB xcpt check, so it will continue without jumping to 0x2800:
            - Saves on the main memory the value for registers R5 and R6, because we will use them to compute
              the physical address.
            - Reads the @ fault value from rm1 and copies it to R5. Then, it computes de physical address and
              stores it on R6.
            - Performs a TLBWRITE instruction targetting the iTLB.
            - Forces the core to jump to address 0x2040:
                - Restores the value for R5 and R6, and jumps to 0x2800 to restore all the registers value and 
                  performs the IRET again, which returns the core to the PC 0x1018 and puts privilege mode to User.

    - The core starts executing from PC 0x1018 again and it hits on iTLB, so the returned physical address is now 
      0x3018. The core starts executing from there where we put an ADDI instruction to R15 with a value of 0x1234
      to check that everything has been executed as expected. 

    - Then, it will fetch the next instruction (virt. PC = 101C, phy PC = 0x301C), which is a LD to address 0x1050,  
      since dTLB is empty it will generate an xcpt and will force the core to jump again to the xcpt handler (0x2000).

    - Once the core is on the xcpt handler it will check which kind of xcpt has been raised, and it will generate
      a physical address for the given virtual address that failed (virt. addr fault 0x1050, generated phy addr = 0x3050). 
      
    - Next, the xcpt handler will perform a TLBWRITE on the dTLB, will restore the registers value and jump back to the 
      PC where it failed (virt. PC = 101C, phy PC = 0x301C). Then, on the next attempt it will find that data is at address
      0x3050, and it will write the main memory content (0xABCDEF01) on R7.

    - Finally, it will perform a JUMP (virt. PC = 1020, phy PC = 0x3020) to address 0x1040, which means that it will look
      on iTLB and it will return phy addr 0x3040. It will try to fetch from there and it read NOPs.
 
- If evertyhing goes as expected we should see the next values on the registers:
        - R2  = 0x1000
        - R5  = 0x6BCD
        - R6  = 0x6BCD
        - R7  = 0xABCDEF01
        - R15 = 0x1234
        - R28 = 0x6BCD
        - R29 = 0x6BCD
        - R30 = 0x6BCD

Result:
